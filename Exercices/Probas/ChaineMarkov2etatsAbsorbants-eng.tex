\subsubsection{Markov chain with two absorbing states}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We consider a Markov chain $(X_n)_{n \geq 0}$ with values in $\{0, \dots, \ell\}$, and we note $p_{i, j}$ the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$. It is assumed that 
$$
p_{0, 0} = p_{\ell, \ell} = 1 
$$
and that, for any $1 \leq i, j \leq \ell-1$, 
$$
p_{i, 0} = a > 0, \qquad p_{i, \ell} = b > 0, \qquad p_{i, j} \geq 0.
$$
We also note $T_{i, j}$ the time to reach the state $j$ from the state $i$:
$$
T_{i, j} = \min\{n: X_n = j \mid X_0 = i\}.
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Give the transition matrix and draw the transition graph of this Markov chain.
  \item What are the communication classes of this chain? Give their nature. What are the possible asymptotic behaviors of this chain?
  \item Let $1 \leq i \leq \ell-1$, give the probability that $X_{n+1} \in \{1, \dots \ell-1\}$ knowing that $X_n = i$.
  \item Deduce that, for $1 \leq i \leq \ell-1$, noting $c = a + b$, 
  $$
  \Pr\{T_{i, 0} = n\} = a (1 - c)^{n-1}, \qquad
  \Pr\{T_{i, \ell} = n\} = b (1 - c)^{n-1}.
  $$
  \item For $1 \leq i \leq \ell-1$, we now note $T_i$ the absorption time (in 0 or in $\ell$) : 
  $$
  T_i = \min(T_{i, 0}, T_{i, \ell}).
  $$
  Show that $T_i$ has a geometric distribution $\Gcal(c)$ : $\Pr\{T_i = n\} = c (1 - c)^{n-1}$. \\
  Deduce its expectation.  
%   \item Montrer que, pour $1 \leq i \leq \ell-1$, 
%   $$
%   \Pr\{T_{i, 0} < n\} = \frac{a [1 - (1 - c)^{n-1}]}{c}.
%   $$
%   \solution{
%   \begin{align*}
%   \Pr\{T_{i, 0} < n\} 
%   & = \sum_{m =1}^{n-1} \Pr\{T_{i, 0} = m \} 
%   = a \sum_{m = 1}^{n-1} (1 - c)^{m-1} \\
%   & = \frac{a [1 - (1 - c)^{n-1}]}{1 - (1 - c)} 
%   = \frac{a [1 - (1 - c)^{n-1}]}{c}.
%   \end{align*}}
  \item For $1 \leq i \leq \ell-1$, calculate the probability that, starting from $X_0 = i$ the Markov chain reaches the state 0 before the state $\ell$.
  \item What are the respective expectations of $T_{i, 0}$ and $T_{i, \ell}$ for $1 \leq i \leq \ell-1$?
\end{enumerate}
